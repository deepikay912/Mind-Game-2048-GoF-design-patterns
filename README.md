## Project Progress
Initially the project started with fast pace and then there were ups and downs due to conflicts and code cleaning .Then we caught the pace and finished the project in anticipated time.

We tracked issues in project dashboard as:
 * TO-DO
 * IN PROGRESS
 * DONE
 * CLOSED
 
 which made us track the status of project at any time.
